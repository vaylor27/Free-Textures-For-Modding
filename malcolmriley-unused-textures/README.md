# Unused Textures

![Sample](samples.png)

This repository contains a number of textures I've created over the years. They're not really doing me any good sitting on my hard drive so I've gathered them here for you to use. While they were originally intended for use in various never-finished or never-released mods for Minecraft, I suppose you could use them for just about anything else. Other games, an application icon, YouTube channel logo...

Most are just simple 16x16 RGBA sprites; of those that were intended to be animated, I have included accompanying `.mcmeta` files for the convenience of those interested in incorporating them into their own Minecraft mods. They vary in quality somewhat as they collectively represent approximately seven years of what I would like to believe is self-improvement.

I tried to name the textures such that any local clone of the repository would be searchable (for instance, one can search `"blob"` to get all the "blobby" textures) but I hesitate to call the naming pattern a "system"... or even a "pattern" for that matter.

I've been updating this repository every now and then as I create new textures or find more old ones, so if you've forked or cloned this, don't forget to at least do a `git fetch` every once in a while!
